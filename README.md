# Autism-prediciton-using-machine-learning
Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning, where we analyze the Autism Prediction dataset, preprocess data, apply classification algorithms, and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on various features like behavioral, medical, and demographic data.
Use datasets containing information such as early childhood behavior, medical history, family health background, and developmental milestones.
Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC, along with cross-validation to ensure generalizability.
 Fine-tune hyperparameters of models using methods like grid search to improve performance.
 Use techniques like SHAP or LIME to provide insights into the most influential features for predictions, helping explain model behavior.
 Address data imbalance (e.g., underrepresentation of ASD cases), privacy concerns (e.g., HIPAA compliance), and the interpretability of complex models.
 Create an early detection tool that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing autism and provide valuable insights for intervention and support.
